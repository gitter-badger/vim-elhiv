# vim-elhiv
This is a library written in VimL.

elhiv stands for extreme language hacking in VimL. Extreme language hacking is my programming style, but this is actually just a VimL library used by my Vim plugins.

**Installation**

Install it the normal way you install Vim plugins, nothing special.
